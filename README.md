# Mock-Airline-Website
A mock website using RESTful services alongside standard Javascript/HTML/CSS.

This website was created by me, as well as another student.
It allows a user to:
- Log in to an account
- Edit their personal information
- View all possible flights, as well as book any
- View their saved tickets, as well as delete any
- Use Google Maps API to view real-life locations of airports

Note: The database that was used in this project was hosted on UNC servers, and can't be accessed remotely.
Thus, only the login page is visible; the rest cannot be accessed as-is, since login can't be completed without database access.
To view the rest of the site, one could remove the script building the login page and send the user directly to some other view;
however, as all features are dependent on the backend for functionality, there would be little else to see.
